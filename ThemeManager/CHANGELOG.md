# Changelog

## 0.6.0
Released on April 13th, 2024.

It's been a while. This is the initial 1.6 release. There are a lot
of behind the scenes changes. The C# API is not ready, though, so
it doesn't matter, really. Hopefully we get that fixed soon.

Content pack authors can go nuts, though.


## 0.5.0
Released on November 18th, 2022.

* This is the initial public release.
