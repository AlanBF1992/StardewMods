This repository contains all of my Stardew Valley mods, released or not. Of note...

 Almanac provides an in-game book with useful information about different subjects,
 including a long term weather forecast and when to plant crops.

## Better Crafting ([NexusMods](https://www.nexusmods.com/stardewvalley/mods/11115))

Better Crafting adds a new crafting UI with support for customizable categories,
favorites, and a uniform grid size. It also prevents use of a workbench from
keeping chests locked when playing in multiplayer.
